				<p class="col-sm text-white text-start mt-5">Aligned with the Philippine Development Plan 2017 - 2022, the Rural Agro-enterprise Partnership for Inclusive Development and Growth (RAPID Growth) Project aims to intensify agro-enterprise development in the rural areas. 

The Project serves as support to the Department of Trade and Industry’s (DTI) thrust, themed as Trabaho, Negosyo and Kabuhayan (TNK), to bring employment, livelihood and enterprises to rural communities and reach more farming households, cooperatives and microenterprises, anchored on the Value Chain Approach. 

The Project adopts a Whole-of-Government Approach (WGA) in the delivery of services – expanding economic opportunities, creating more agro-enterprises particularly in the rural areas, facilitating easy access to market and producers, technology financing, and other business development support services.
